Notebook for fitting unilamellar liposomes SAXS data (Ref: Nielsen et al., Soft Matter, 2018)

This folder contains: 
- nielsen2018_library_demo.py: class with functions for calculating scattering intensities, storing parameters and fitting methods;
- liposomes_nielsen2018_symmetrical.ipynb: notebook for guessing parameters in a graphical user interface, followed by fitting procedures and plotting;
- liposomes_merge_rebin.dat: example of liposome experimental data.

Here I am posting just the version of symmetrical membranes, with no PEG nor ligands associated to it.
